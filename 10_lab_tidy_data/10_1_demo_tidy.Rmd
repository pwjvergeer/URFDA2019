# Tidy data

## Introduction

 * In this lesson, you will learn a consistent way to organise your data in R, an organisation called __tidy data__. 
 * Getting your data into this format requires some upfront work, but that work pays off in the long term. 
 * Once you have tidy data and the tidy tools provided by packages in the tidyverse, you will spend much less time munging data from one representation to another, allowing you to spend more time on the analytic questions at hand.

## {tidyr} package

 * This lesson will give you a practical introduction to tidy data and the accompanying tools in the __tidyr__ package. 

If you'd like to learn more about the underlying theory, you might enjoy the *Tidy Data* paper published in the Journal of Statistical Software, <http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper>.

## Prerequisites

In this chapter we'll focus on tidyr, a package that provides a bunch of tools to help tidy up your messy datasets. tidyr is a member of the core tidyverse.

```{r packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
path_to_tidyr_sticker <- file.path(root, "images", "tidyr_sticker.png")
knitr::include_graphics(path_to_tidyr_sticker, dpi = 80)
```

## Tidy data rules
```{r tidy-structure, echo = FALSE}
path_to_tidydata_image <- file.path(root, "/images/images/tidy-1.png")
knitr::include_graphics(path_to_tidydata_image, dpi = 250)
```

 * Each variable goes in it's own column
 * Each observation goes in a singe row
 * Each cell contains only one value

__**You will need them in (almost) every analysis!**__

## Examples 

 * This dataset concerns tuberculosis incidence in multiple countries over 2 years
 * Each dataset shows the same values of four variables *country*, *year*, *population*, and *cases*
 * Ask yourself: "How are the following tables different?"
 * Check if, and how the table complies to the tidy data rules

## Example 1
```{r}
head(table1, 6)
```

## Example 2
```{r}
head(table2, 6)
```

## Example 3
```{r}
head(table3, 6)
```

## Data can be spread across multiple files/tables
```{r}
head(table4a, 3)  # cases
head(table4b, 3)  # population
```

## One winner!
In the previous example, only `table1` is tidy. It's the only representation where each column is a variable. 

```{r} 
head(table1)
```

## Why tidy data?
Why ensure that your data is tidy? There are two main advantages:

 1. There's a general advantage to picking one consistent way of storing data. If you have a consistent data structure, it's easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity.
    
 2. There's a specific advantage to placing variables in columns because they are vectors. Most built-in R functions work with vectors of values.

## Packages from the tidyverse are designed for tidy data 

Example plot from `table1`
```{r}
# Compute rate per 10,000
table1 %>% 
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)
```

## Compute cases per year
```{r}
table1 %>% 
  count(year, wt = cases)
```

## Visualize changes over time
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(table1, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))
```

## Gathering

When some of the column names are not names of variables, but _values_ of a variable. Take `table4a`: the column names `1999` and `2000` represent values of the `year` variable, and each row represents two observations, not one.

```{r}
table4a
```

## Gathering a set of value columns

To tidy a dataset like this, we need to __gather__ those columns into a new pair of variables. To describe that operation we need three parameters:

* The set of columns that represent values, not variables. In this example, 
  those are the columns `1999` and `2000`.
* The name of the variable whose values form the column names. I call that
  the `key`, and here it is `year`.
* The name of the variable whose values are spread over the cells. I call 
  that `value`, and here it's the number of `cases`.
  
## "gather()"  
```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

## The actions "gather()" performs
```{r tidy-gather, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Gathering `table4` into a tidy form."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(root, "images" , "images", "tidy-9.png"))
```

## Tidy table 4b
```{r}
table4b %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "population")
```

## Joining tables
To combine the tidied versions of `table4a` and `table4b` into a single tibble, we need to use `dplyr::left_join()`
```{r, message=FALSE}
tidy4a <- table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
tidy4b <- table4b %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "population")
joined_4a_4b <- left_join(tidy4a, tidy4b)
joined_4a_4b
```

## Spreading
Spreading is the opposite of gathering. You use it when an observation is scattered across multiple rows. For example, take `table2`: an observation is a country in a year, but each observation is spread across two rows.

```{r}
table2
```

To tidy this up, we first analyse the representation in similar way to `gather()`. This time, however, we only need two parameters:

* The column that contains variable names, the `key` column. Here, it's 
  `type`.
* The column that contains values forms multiple variables, the `value`
  column. Here it's `count`.

## "spread()"
```{r}
spread(table2, key = type, value = count)
```

## The action "spread()" performs
```{r tidy-spread, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Spreading `table2` makes it tidy"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(root, "images", "images", "tidy-8.png"))
```

## "gather()" and "spread()" are complementary
As you might have guessed from the common `key` and `value` arguments, `spread()` and `gather()` are complements. `gather()` makes wide tables narrower and longer; `spread()` makes long tables shorter and wider.

## Separating and uniting

`table3` has a different problem: we have one column (`rate`) that contains two variables (`cases` and `population`). To fix this problem, we'll need the `separate()` function. You'll also learn about the complement of `separate()`: `unite()`, which you use if a single variable is spread across multiple columns.

## "separate()"

`separate()` pulls apart one column into multiple columns, by splitting wherever a separator character appears. Take `table3`:

```{r}
table3
```

## Separating rate into cases and population
```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
```

## The action "separate()" performs
```{r tidy-separate, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Separating `table3` makes it tidy"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(root, "images", "images", "tidy-17.png"))
```

## Unite
`unite()` is the inverse of `separate()`: it combines multiple columns into a single column. 

Look at `?tidyrt::unite()` to see the help and examples

## Missing values

Changing the representation of a dataset brings up an important subtlety of missing values. Surprisingly, a value can be missing in one of two possible ways:

* __Explicitly__, i.e. flagged with `NA`.
* __Implicitly__, i.e. simply not present in the data.

Let's illustrate this idea with a very simple data set:

```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016),
  qtr    = c(   1,    2,    3,    4,    2,    3,    4),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.35,   NA, 0.92, 0.17, 2.66)
)
```

## The stocks dataframe
```{r}
stocks
```

## There are two missing values in this dataset:

 * The return for the fourth quarter of 2015 is explicitly missing, because the cell where its value should be instead contains `NA`.
 * The return for the first quarter of 2016 is implicitly missing, because it simply does not appear in the dataset.

## Making implicit missing values explicit
The way that a dataset is represented can make implicit values explicit. For example, we can make the implicit missing value explicit by putting years in the columns:

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return)
```

## "na.rm = TRUE"
Because these explicit missing values may not be important in other representations of the data, you can set `na.rm = TRUE` in `gather()` to turn explicit missing values implicit:

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return) %>% 
  gather(year, return, `2015`:`2016`, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Explicit misisng values "complete()"
Another important tool for making missing values explicit in tidy data is `complete()`:

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr)
```


## The "complete()" function
`complete()` takes a set of columns, and finds all unique combinations. It then ensures the original dataset contains all those values, filling in explicit `NA`s where necessary.

## Forward carrying
There's one other important tool that you should know for working with missing values. Sometimes when a data source has primarily been used for data entry, missing values indicate that the previous value should be carried forward:

## Carry-forward example
```{r}
(treatment <- tribble(
  ~ person,            ~ treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore",  1,           7,
  NA,                  2,           10,
  NA,                  3,           9,
  "Katherine Burke",   1,           4,
  NA,                  2,           8,
  NA,                  3,           12
))
```

## Filling in the 'missing values'
You can fill in these missing values with `fill()`. It takes a set of columns where you want missing values to be replaced by the most recent non-missing value (sometimes called last observation carried forward).

```{r}
treatment %>% 
  fill(person)
```
