## Directions

 _*Use ggplot2 syntaxis for all the figures in this case study*_

 _*Use packages of the tidyverse, or any other package you think you need to solve the questions below*_ 
 
 _*Use this Rmarkdown template to create a report adressing the assignment below*_ 
 
 _*Hand in the assignment at the before the end of the final course day*_

## Introduction
For the assessment of carcinogenic potential of chemicals, animal testing required. Recently, we have performed a ring trial with two laboratories to acertain the predictive capacity of a reporter cell line to accurately classify chemicals on the basis of reporter signal (fluorescence).

## The case assignment
 1) Create a github repository "case_1_calux" in your account.
 2) Read the data into R 
 3) Inspect the data 
 4) Describe mising values and the type of variables
 5) Generate at least 4 different graphs that describe the data.
 6) Answer the case questions below.
 7) Upload a rendered (github_document) and the Rmd file to you github account
 8) Sent the teacher an email with the link to the files
 
## **TIPs**

 - For this case you need to know about importing data in R. The file is csv format, remember to set the `na.strings`. Determine the delimiter used in the datafile. You can open the file in a text editor.
 - Remember the programming rules: use `snake_case` for all variables in the data and in your script.
 - Use the syntax from the {tidyverse} as much a possible
 - You are allowed to use google/stack overflow, whatever you can find to solve the questions
 - All graphics must be made with {ggplot2}
 - Remember {dplyr} to `select()`, `filter()`, `group_by()`, `mutate()` and `summarize()` data
 - Check the type of each variable in the data. Do you need to change the variable type like `data$var_1 <- as.factor(data$var_1)`? 

## Case questions

Try to answer the next 4 questions:

Graph 1) 
How does the relationship between the chemicals (`$name`) and the `$p53_cyto_mec` variable look?

Graph 2) 
Can you plot the relationships between the `$class` variable and the `$p53.ifmax` variable for each `$laboratory`? 

Graph 3) 
Make a graph with facets that displays only chemicals that have an induction of mean `p53.ifmax` of above 5.0.
 
Graph 4)
Create a meaningful bar-graph for this data set. You can choose what to plot yourself

 ## Review criteria
 
 - Your code must provide the steps above in such a way that someone else can understand the code.
 - Provide a clear description of what your code does
 - Describe the graphs in your report. 
 - Provide the complete code in a rendered Rmd (to HTML) file 
 
## Case data
Load the data from the data folder "//root/data/case_1_calux/"

This folder contains two files: 

`r pander::pander(list.files(paste0(root, "/data/case_1_calux/")))`

The data for this case is in the file "zomw_calux_all_data.csv"

You need to change the names of the variables to the "conventions" (e.g. `$p53_cyto_mec`) do this first after loading the data.

**Write a code chunk below that loads the data file "zonmw_calux_all_data.csv". You can use the {readr} package for this. Remember to specify the `na` value. Inspect the file first in the editor to see what the file looks like.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data_path <- file.path(root, "data", "case_1_calux", "zonmw_calux_all_data.csv")
prevalidation <- read_delim(data_path, 
    na = "NA", delim = ";") 
```

The dimensions of the data, if properly loaded into R are:
`r dim(prevalidation)` rows by columns

## Adding row_id
Remember "Data management" it is good idea to add a row id. Add a row with row id from 1: `nrow` of the data
```{r}
prevalidation <- prevalidation %>% 
  mutate(row_id = c(1:nrow(prevalidation))) %>% select(row_id:Study)

names(prevalidation) <- tolower(names(prevalidation)) 
names(prevalidation)
head(prevalidation)
```

## Change names of variables. 
Remove the spaces in names and set all names to lower type case.
```{r}
library(stringr)
new_names <- str_replace_all(names(prevalidation), 
                             pattern = "\\.", replacement = "_")
new_names
new_names <- str_replace_all(new_names, 
                  pattern = " ", replacement = "_")
new_names

names(prevalidation) <- new_names
names(prevalidation)
```
## Case question that will help you create the above 4 graphs:

## 1) Geoms
The chemicals tested were divided into 3 classes. This graph is about showing the realationship between the chemicals and the induction of p53. Can you think of a way to convey this information in a plot? What type or types of `geom_` will you use?

## 2) The variables in the data
Which variable types are represented in the data. You can find more information in the "variables_calux.md" file.
Change the type of the variable if necessary. For example from "character" to "factor". Do you remeber which function to use. Consult your neighbour and discuss if not. Or try googling.
```{r}
library(forcats)
?forcats
str(prevalidation)
## change type of variables

?tapply

as_factor_vars <- c("s9_mix", "nr", "name", 
                  "class", "laboratory", "study")

prevalidation <- prevalidation %>%
       mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), as_factor_vars)
str(prevalidation)
```

## 3) Complete cases 
The dataset has a number of missing values and incomplete cases.
First filter the data for all the cases that are complete. Google how you can assess "complete" cases in a dataframe.
```{r}
?complete.cases
complete_ind <- complete.cases(prevalidation)
complete_prevalidation <- prevalidation[complete_ind,]
head(complete_prevalidation)
```

## 4) Summarize data
Do you need to calculate means for every chemical?
In oder to investigate relations it is probably a good idea to calculate the mean of the duplos (you can see two observations for most chemical).
Calculate a summary where you `group_by(laboratory, name, nr, class, s9_mix)`
Use this summary for graph 2-4.

```{r}
summary <- complete_prevalidation %>% 
  select(laboratory, s9_mix, nr, class, name, p53_cyto_mec, p53_ifmax) %>%
  group_by(laboratory, name, nr, class, s9_mix) %>%
  summarise(mean_p53_if = mean(p53_ifmax), 
            sd_p53_if = sd(p53_ifmax),
            mean_p53_cyto_mec = mean(p53_cyto_mec),
            sd_p53_cyto_mec = mean(p53_cyto_mec))
head(summary)
```

**ANSWERS** 

Write code chunks below that create the required plots.

## Plot 1:
How does the relationship between the chemicals (`$name`) and the `$p53_cyto_mec` variable look?
```{r}
prevalidation$class <- as.factor(prevalidation$class)
names(prevalidation)
ggplot(data = prevalidation, aes(x = nr, y = p53_cyto_mec)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) 
```

## Plot 2: 
 Can you plot the relationships between the `$name`, the `$class` variable and the `$p53.ifmax` variable for each `$laboratory`? Make this plot from summarized data (sumarize the observation for each duplo measurement) 
```{r}
names(summary)
ggplot(data = summary, aes(x = nr, y = mean_p53_if)) +
  geom_point() +
## add labels to the chemicals
    geom_text(aes(label = name), hjust = 0, vjust = 0) +
## add facets
facet_wrap(class ~ laboratory, ncol = 2)
```

```{r}
names(summary)
str(summary)
summary$class <- as.factor(summary$class)
fac_summary <- c("laboratory", "class", "s9_mix", "name", "nr")
## convert factors to factors
#summary <- summary %>% mutate_at(fac_summary, funs(factor(.))) 
## figure call
  summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = nr, y = mean_p53_if)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = class)) +

facet_wrap(~ laboratory, ncol = 2)
```

## Plot 3 
Make a graph with facets that display only the chemical that have an induction of mean p53_if of above 5.0.
```{r}
names(summary)
summary %>% filter(mean_p53_if >= 5.0) %>%

ggplot(aes(x = nr, y = mean_p53_if)) +
  geom_point() +
## add labels to the chemicals
    geom_text(aes(label = name), hjust = 0, vjust = 0) +
## add facets
facet_wrap(class ~ laboratory, ncol = 2)
```
 
 What can you conclude from this plot on the relation between class of the chemical and the induction of p53_if_max?

Plot 4
Create a meaningful bar-graph for this data set. You can choose what to plot yourself
See e.g. page 29 from "r4ds"
```{r}
names(summary)
ggplot(data = summary, aes(x = class, y = mean_p53_if)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = laboratory), stat = "identity",
           position = "dodge") 
```
