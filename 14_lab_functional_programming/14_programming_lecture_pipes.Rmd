## Pipes

 - The pipe, `%>%`, comes from the __magrittr__ package by Stefan Milton Bache
 - Load it explicitly:

```{r magrittr, message = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
```

## Piping alternatives

 - It helps you write code in a way that is easier to read and understand. To see why the pipe is so useful, we're going to explore a number of ways of writing the same code. Let's use code to sing a song:
 
 *_"Clocks"_* by Coldplay
 
 *The lights go out and I can't be saved*

 *Tides that I tried to swim against*

 *Have brought me down upon my knees*

 *Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing*

## How to tell a code story?

First we create the crucial variable in this song "I"
```{r, eval = FALSE}
I <- "me"

```

And we'll use a function for each key verb: 

 - `saved()`
 - `swim()`
 - `brought()`
 - `beg()`
 - `singing()`

## Four ways to recap the song
Using the object `I` and these verbs, there are (at least) four ways we could retell the song in code:

 1. Save each intermediate step as a new object.
 2. Overwrite the original object many times.
 3. Compose functions.
 4. Use the pipe.

## Intermediate steps
The simplest approach is to save each step as a new object:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
me_1 <- saved(I, can = FALSE, lights = "out")
me_2 <- swim(I,  tides = "against")
me_3 <- brought(me_2, down = TRUE, knees = "upon")
me_4 <- singing(beg(I, plead = TRUE, square = TRUE)
```

## Cluttering code by naming variables
 - It forces you to name each intermediate element. 
 - If there are natural names, this is a good idea, and you should do it. 
 - In this example, there aren't natural names, and you add numeric suffixes to make the names unique. That leads to two problems:

 1. The code is cluttered with unimportant names
 2. You have to carefully increment the suffix on each line. 

## Sidestep: Do not worry about objects occupying memory 
```{r}
diamonds <- ggplot2::diamonds
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(price_per_carat = price / carat)

pryr::object_size(diamonds); pryr::object_size(diamonds2)
pryr::object_size(diamonds, diamonds2)
```

## Memory object size
`pryr::object_size()` gives the memory occupied by all of its arguments. The results seem counterintuitive at first:

* `diamonds` takes up 3.46 MB,
* `diamonds2` takes up 3.89 MB,
* `diamonds` and `diamonds2` together take up 3.89 MB!

## How can that work? 
 - `diamonds2` has 10 columns in common with `diamonds`: 
 - There's no need to duplicate all that data, 
 - The two data frames have variables in common. 
 - These variables will only get copied if you modify one of them. 
 
## Modifying a value increases memory occupation 
we modify a single value in `diamonds$carat`. 

```{r}
diamonds$carat[1] <- NA
pryr::object_size(diamonds); pryr::object_size(diamonds2)
pryr::object_size(diamonds, diamonds2)

```

## Back to *Clocks*: Overwrite the original

Instead of creating intermediate objects at each step, we could overwrite the original object:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
me <- saved(I, can = FALSE, lights = "out")
me <- swim(I,  tides = "against")
me <- brought(me, down = TRUE, knees = "upon")
me <- singing(beg(I, plead = TRUE, square = TRUE))
```

This is less typing (and less thinking), so you're less likely to make mistakes. However, there are two problems:

 1. Debugging is painful: if you make a mistake you'll need to re-run the complete pipeline from the beginning.
 2. The repetition of the object being transformed (we've written `me` multiple times!) obscures what's changing on each line. 

## Function composition

Another approach is to abandon assignment and just string the function calls together:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
saved(singing(
  beg(I, plead = TRUE, square = TRUE,    
    brought(me, down = TRUE, knees = "upon"),
    swim(I, tides = "against")
    )), can = FALSE, lights = "out"
  )
```

Because of the parentheses `(())`, this code is hard for a human to consume.

## Use the pipe 

Finally, we can use the pipe:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
me <- saved(I, can = FALSE, lights = "out") %>%
  swim(tides = "against") %>%
  brought(down = TRUE, knees = "upon") %>%
  beg(plead = TRUE, square = TRUE) %>%
  singing()
```

"You read this like: me can be saved, the lights are out, then me swims against the tides, then me is brought down upon knees, then me is begging (two tiimes) and pleading, while singing."

sounds familiar?

The pipe operator feeds the object from the left call to the expression on the right.

## Let's look at an arithmetic example
 - Assume we want to take the mean of 100 random normals, 
 - Take the square root of that mean, 
 - Multiply that number by the number of normals,  
 - Take this number and add 234*123 
 - And finally feed that into a variable called "var_sum"
 
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
var_sum_pipe <- rnorm(100) %>%
  mean() %>%
  sqrt() %>%
  multiply_by(100) %>% # could have used `*` as well
  add(234*123) # could have used `+` here as well

# look at ?maggrittr::extract for various aliases to 'normal' arithmethic  functions to use in a pipe  
```
 
## The above in 'normal' R code
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
var_sum_normal <- 
((234*123) + (100*sqrt(mean(rnorm(100)
               )
          )
))
var_sum_normal
var_sum_normal == var_sum_pipe
``` 
 
## See the difference?? 
 * Both options do the same thing!!
 * Although the pipe option is a bit more typing, it is certainly much more human-readable: 
 * Remember "Write code for humans, not for computers"

## Other tools from magrittr
 - The "r4ds" book gives you more information on how to use other tools from {magrittr} and also when not to use the pipe. 
 - This is out of scope of the course and just try anyway!!
