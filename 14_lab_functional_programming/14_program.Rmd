```{r, root_1, include=FALSE}
## defines the root of the project for later use
require("rprojroot") || utils::install.packages("rprojroot")
library(rprojroot)
root <- find_root_file(criterion = is_rstudio_project)
```

```
## Programming is a creative and iterative process, it takes time to learn an practice to maintain

**__"Ten minutes of R a day, keeps Excel away"__**

## R-programming 

 - Improve your programming skills 
 - Programming is needed for all data science work
 - You must use a computer to do data science;
 - You cannot do it in your head
 - Or with pencil and paper

## Data wrangling
```{r, echo = FALSE}
path_to_wrangle_diagram <- file.path(root, "images", "data-science.png")
knitr::include_graphics(path_to_wrangle_diagram, dpi = 60)
```

## "Write code for humans, not for computers"
 - Code is a tool of communication
 - It tells the computer what to do 
 - It tells human beings what the computer is supposed to do
 - Think of code as a vehicle for communication 
 - Annotate code with "# Comments"
 - Write code and comments in English!!, why?
 - Future-you will be grateful! 
 - Getting better at programming also involves getting better at communicating.
 - It improves your typing skills

## Write clear and consistently formatted code
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# reads data file 1 (SHL) 
shl_91010 <- 
   read.csv(file = paste0(root, 
     "/data-raw/RAAK 91010 pat gb 19800101 1e van 2_SHL_EDITED.csv"), 
                    sep = ";", 
                    na.strings = "-", 
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# reads data file 2 (SHL) 
shl_56006 <- 
   read.csv(file = paste0(root, 
     "/data-raw/RAAK_56006_1e_van_2_SHL_EDITED.csv"), 
                    sep = ";", 
                    na.strings = "-", 
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
## Rewriting is key!!
 
 - The first expression of your ideas is unlikely to be particularly clear or even complete
 - You may need to rewrite multiple times
 - It's worth looking at your code and thinking about whether or not it's obvious what you've done. 
 - If you spend time rewriting your code while the ideas are fresh, you can save a lot of time later trying to recreate what your code did. 
 - Do not rewrite every function you write, most of the times "good is good enought"

# Programming lectures

## Lecture 1: Vectors
 R has a few datastructures that you need to know
 
 - Vector
 - List
 - Dataframe
 - Matrix
 
## Lecture 2: The pipe operator
 
```
result <- a data object %>%
  do_first_this %>%
  than_do_this %>%
  than_that %>%
  result
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path(root, "images", "pipe.png"),
                        dpi = 80)
```


## Lecture 3: Writing functions
 
 * Basic function template
 * How to write functions
 * Messages, Warnings and Errors
 * Using functions
 * Source functions
 
 ## Lecture 4: Iteration

  * `for`-loops
  * `if`-staments
  * `map` family of functions
  * The `{purrr}` package
