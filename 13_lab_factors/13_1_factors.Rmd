## Introduction

 * In R, factors are used to work with categorical variables  
 * Variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values.  
 * They are also useful when you want to display character vectors in a non-alphabetical order.

## A short example
```{r, echo=FALSE}
names <- tibble(surname = c("Marc", "Pascal", 
                            "Stefan", "Ronald",
                            "Arie-Jaak", "Mieke"),
                hobby = c("Climbing", "Climbing",
                          "Swimming", "Running",
                          "Karate", "Swimming"))
```

```{r}
names 
names$hobby <- as_factor(names$hobby) 
```

## Checking the change to factor
```{r}
names
levels(names$hobby)
```

## Prerequisites

 * To work with **fac**tors, we'll use the __forcats__ package, which provides tools for dealing with **cat**egorical variables
 
 * It provides a wide range of helpers for working with factors. forcats is not part of the core tidyverse
 * We need to load it explicitly.
```{r packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
```

## Creating factors

Imagine that you have a variable that records month:
```{r}
x1 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")
```

Using a string to record this variable has two problems:

## Levels

There are only twelve possible months, and there's nothing saving you from typos:
```{r}
x2 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jam", "Mar")
```

## Sorting

It doesn't sort in a useful way:
```{r}
sort(x1)
```

## Creating a list of valid levels

 * You can fix both of these problems with a factor. 
 * To create a factor you must start by creating a list of the valid __levels__:

```{r}
month_levels <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
```

## Now you can create a factor:

```{r}
y1 <- factor(x1, levels = month_levels)
y1
sort(y1)
```

## Missing levels
And any values not in the set will be silently converted to NA:

```{r}
y2 <- factor(x2, levels = month_levels)
y2
```

## Warnings prevent typos
If you want a warning, you can use `readr::parse_factor()`:

```{r}
y2 <- parse_factor(x2, levels = month_levels)
```

If you omit the levels, they'll be taken from the data in alphabetical order:

```{r}
factor(x1)
```

## Setting the order to order of appearance

```{r}
f1 <- factor(x1, levels = unique(x1))
f1

f2 <- x1 %>% factor() %>% fct_inorder()
f2
```

##Acces the levels of factor
If you ever need to access the set of valid levels directly, you can do so with `levels()`:

```{r}
levels(f2)
```

## General Social Survey

For the rest of this lesson, we're going to focus on `forcats::gss_cat`. It's a sample of data from the [General Social Survey](http://gss.norc.org), which is a long-running US survey conducted by the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago. 

```{r}
gss_cat
```

## Investigating a factor

 * When factors are stored in a tibble, you can't see their levels so easily. 
 * One way to see them is with `count()`:

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  count(race)
```

## Or with a bar chart:

```{r}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race)) +
  geom_bar()
```
__Here you can not see "empty" levels__

## Unused levels
```{r}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE)
```

## Modifying factor order
```{r, echo=FALSE}
relig <- gss_cat %>%
  group_by(relig) %>%
  summarise(
    age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    tvhours = mean(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n())
ggplot(relig, aes(tvhours, relig)) + geom_point()
```

## Improving the factor ordering
We can improve it by reordering the levels of `relig` using `fct_reorder()`. `fct_reorder()` takes three arguments:

* `f`, the factor whose levels you want to modify.
* `x`, a numeric vector that you want to use to reorder the levels.
* Optionally, `fun`, a function that's used if there are multiple values of
  `x` for each value of `f`. The default value is `median`.

## Reordered
```{r}
ggplot(relig, aes(tvhours, fct_reorder(relig, tvhours))) +
  geom_point()
```

## Using "mutate()"
As you start making more complicated transformations, I'd recommend moving them out of `aes()` and into a separate `mutate()` step. For example, you could rewrite the plot above as:

```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.width=0.5, fig.height=0.5}
relig %>%
  mutate(relig = fct_reorder(relig, tvhours)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(tvhours, relig)) +
    geom_point()
```
__This makes

## "fct_relevel" vs "fct_reorder" 
What if we create a similar plot looking at how average age varies across reported income level?

```{r, fig.width=2, fig.height=2}
rincome <- gss_cat %>%
  group_by(rincome) %>%
  summarise(
    age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    tvhours = mean(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n())
ggplot(rincome, aes(age, fct_reorder(rincome, age))) + geom_point()
```

## Arbitrary order vs principle order

 * Here, arbitrarily reordering the levels isn't a good idea! 
 * That's because `rincome` already has a principled order that we shouldn't mess with. 
 * Reserve `fct_reorder()` for factors whose levels are arbitrarily ordered.

## Using "fct_relevel"

 * It does make sense to pull "Not applicable" to the front with the other special levels. 
 * You can use `fct_relevel()`. 
 * It takes a factor, `f`, and then any number of levels that you want to move to the front of the line.

```{r}
ggplot(rincome, aes(age, fct_relevel(rincome, "Not applicable"))) +
  geom_point()
```

## Recode factors for line colours
`fct_reorder2()` reorders the factor by the `y` values associated with the largest `x` values. This makes the plot easier to read because the line colours line up with the legend.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "default", out.width = "50%", fig.width = 4}
by_age <- gss_cat %>%
  filter(!is.na(age)) %>%
  group_by(age, marital) %>%
  count() %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))

ggplot(by_age, aes(age, prop, colour = marital)) +
  geom_line(na.rm = TRUE)

ggplot(by_age, aes(age, prop, colour = fct_reorder2(marital, age, prop))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(colour = "marital")
```

## Order factors for bar plots
```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(marital = marital %>% fct_infreq() %>% fct_rev()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(marital)) +
    geom_bar()
```

## Modifying factor level values

 * The most general and powerful tool is `fct_recode()`.   * It allows you to recode, or change, the value of each level. For example, take the `gss_cat$partyid`:

```{r}
gss_cat %>% count(partyid)
```

## Changing level labels, example

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat"
  )) %>%
  count(partyid)
```

## Collapsing levels
```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat",
    "Other"                 = "No answer",
    "Other"                 = "Don't know",
    "Other"                 = "Other party"
  )) %>%
  count(partyid)
```

## Collapse many levels
If you want to collapse a lot of levels, `fct_collapse()` is a useful variant of `fct_recode()`. For each new variable, you can provide a vector of old levels:

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_collapse(partyid,
    other = c("No answer", "Don't know", "Other party"),
    rep = c("Strong republican", "Not str republican"),
    ind = c("Ind,near rep", "Independent", "Ind,near dem"),
    dem = c("Not str democrat", "Strong democrat")
  )) %>%
  count(partyid)
```

## Lump levels together
Sometimes you just want to lump together all the small groups to make a plot or table simpler. That's the job of `fct_lump()`:

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(relig = fct_lump(relig)) %>%
  count(relig)
```

## Specifying how many groups
Instead, we can use the `n` parameter to specify how many groups (excluding other) we want to keep:

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(relig = fct_lump(relig, n = 10)) %>%
  count(relig, sort = TRUE) %>%
  print(n = Inf)
```
